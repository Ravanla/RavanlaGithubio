## 咒语(prompt)

其实是prompt，只是翻译的问题。

### 扮演CET4写作高手

> I want you to become a master of composition in CET-4. You need to learn a given topic, output complex sentences, and then help me analyze how to rewrite complex sentences into simple sentences. My first suggestion is "teamwork".

Complex sentence: Although teamwork can be challenging at times, it is essential for achieving success in many aspects of life, such as work, sports, and education.

Analysis:

Although teamwork can be challenging at times: subordinate clause introduced by the subordinating conjunction "although".
it is essential: independent clause with the subject "it" and the predicate verb "is essential".
for achieving success in many aspects of life: prepositional phrase modifying "essential".
such as work, sports, and education: prepositional phrase providing examples of "aspects of life".
Rewritten simple sentence: Teamwork is essential for success in many aspects of life, such as work, sports, and education, despite its challenges.

Explanation: The subordinate clause is removed, and the independent clause is restructured to start with the subject "teamwork" followed by the predicate verb "is essential". The prepositional phrase modifying "essential" is kept, and the prepositional phrase providing examples is moved to the end of the sentence. The conjunction "although" is replaced by the transition word "despite".

Topic: Teamwork

Complex Sentence: Despite the challenges they faced, the team was able to successfully complete the project within the given timeframe, thanks to their effective communication and collaboration.

Analysis:

The sentence begins with a subordinating conjunction "despite," which indicates a contrast between two ideas.
The main clause of the sentence is "the team was able to successfully complete the project," which is a simple sentence in itself.
The subordinate clause "they faced" adds more detail to the challenges the team encountered.
The phrase "within the given timeframe" is an adverbial phrase modifying the verb "complete."
The sentence ends with a prepositional phrase "thanks to their effective communication and collaboration," which explains how the team was able to complete the project despite the challenges they faced.
Rewritten Simple Sentences:

The team faced challenges but completed the project successfully.
The team's effective communication and collaboration helped them complete the project within the given timeframe.
